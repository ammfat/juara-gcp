# Predict Taxi Fare with a BigQuery ML Forecasting Model

1. Explore NYC taxi cab data.

    Trips per month:

    ```sql
    SELECT
    TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(pickup_datetime, MONTH) month
    , COUNT(*) trips
    FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`
    GROUP BY
    1
    ORDER BY
    1
    ```

    Avg. Speed each hour:

    ```sql
    SELECT
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) hour
    , ROUND(AVG(trip_distance / TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime, pickup_datetime, SECOND)) * 3600, 1) speed
    FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`
    WHERE
    trip_distance > 0
    AND fare_amount/trip_distance BETWEEN 2 AND 10
    AND dropoff_datetime > pickup_datetime
    GROUP BY
    1
    ORDER BY
    1
    ```

1. Select features and create your training dataset.

    ```sql
    WITH params AS (
    SELECT
        1 AS TRAIN
        , 2 AS EVAL 
    ), daynames AS (
        SELECT [
        'Sun'
        , 'Mon'
        , 'Tues'
        , 'Wed'
        , 'Thurs'
        , 'Fri'
        , 'Sat'
        ] AS daysofweek
    ), taxitrips AS (
        SELECT
        (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare
        , daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek
        , EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday
        , pickup_longitude AS pickuplon
        , pickup_latitude AS pickuplat
        , dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon
        , dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat
        , passenger_count AS passengers
        FROM
        `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
        , daynames
        , params
        WHERE
        trip_distance > 0
        AND fare_amount > 0
        AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN 
    )
    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    taxitrips
    ```

1. Create dataset `taxi`

1. Select a BigQuery ML model type and specify options.

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL
    taxi.taxifare_model
    OPTIONS (model_type='linear_reg',labels=['total_fare']) 
    AS (
    WITH params AS (
        SELECT
        1 AS TRAIN
        , 2 AS EVAL 
        ), daynames AS (
        SELECT [
            'Sun'
            , 'Mon'

            , 'Wed'
            , 'Thurs'
            , 'Fri'
            , 'Sat'
        ] AS daysofweek
        ), taxitrips AS (
        SELECT
            (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare
            , daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek
            , EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday
            , pickup_longitude AS pickuplon
            , pickup_latitude AS pickuplat
            , dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon
            , dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat
            , passenger_count AS passengers
        FROM
            `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
            , daynames
            , params
        WHERE
            trip_distance > 0

            AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN 
        )
    SELECT
        *

                , params
            WHERE
                trip_distance > 0
                AND fare_amount > 0

        )
    )
    ```

1. Improving the model with Feature Engineering.

    **Filtering the training dataset**

    Identify outliers:

    ```sql
    SELECT
    COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
    MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
    MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
    AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
    STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
    FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
    # 1,108,779,463 fares
    ```

    As you can see, there are some strange outliers in our dataset (negative fares or fares over $50,000). Apply some of our subject matter expertise to help the model avoid learning on strange outliers.

    Limit the data to only fares between $$6 and $$200:

    ```sql
    SELECT
    COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
    MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
    MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
    AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
    STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
    FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
    WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
    # 843,834,902 fares
    ```

    And more:

    ```sql
    SELECT
    COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
    MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
    MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
    AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
    STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
    FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
    WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
        AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
        AND pickup_longitude < -73
        AND dropoff_longitude > -75
        AND dropoff_longitude < -73
        AND pickup_latitude > 40
        AND pickup_latitude < 42
        AND dropoff_latitude > 40
        AND dropoff_latitude < 42
        # 827,365,869 fares
    ```

    **Retraining the model**

    ```sql
