# Create ML Models with BigQuery ML: Challenge Lab

1. Create a dataset to store your machine learning models.

1. Create a forecasting BigQuery machine learning model.

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL
    `austin.location_model`
    OPTIONS
    (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes'])
    AS (
    SELECT
        start_station_name
        , EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour
        , EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week
        , address as location
        , duration_minutes
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` trips
    JOIN
        `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` stations
        ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id
    WHERE
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2016
        AND duration_minutes > 0
    )
    ```

1. Create the second machine learning model.

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL
    `austin.subscriber_model`
    OPTIONS
    (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes'])
    AS (
    SELECT
        start_station_name
        , EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour
        , subscriber_type
        , duration_minutes
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` trips
    WHERE
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2016
        AND duration_minutes > 0
    )
    ```

1. Evaluate the two machine learning models

    Model 1:    
    ```sql
    SELECT
    mean_absolute_error
    , SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
    FROM
    ML.EVALUATE(
        MODEL `qwiklabs-gcp-01-93ef79d4da86.austin.location_model`
        , (
        SELECT
            start_station_name
            , EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour
            , EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week
            , address as location
            , duration_minutes
        FROM
            `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` trips
        JOIN
            `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` stations
            ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id
        WHERE
            EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
            AND duration_minutes > 0
        )
    )
    ```

    Model 2:
    ```sql
    SELECT
    mean_absolute_error
    , SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
    FROM
    ML.EVALUATE(
        MODEL `qwiklabs-gcp-01-93ef79d4da86.austin.subscriber_model`
        , (
        SELECT
            start_station_name
            , EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour
            , subscriber_type
            , duration_minutes
        FROM
            `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` trips
        WHERE
            EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
            AND duration_minutes > 0
        )
    )
    ```

1. Use the subscriber type machine learning model to predict average trip durations

    Find busiest station:
    ```sql
    SELECT
    start_station_name
    , COUNT(*) AS cnt_trips
    FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
    -- AND subscriber_type = 'Single Trip'
    GROUP BY
    1
    ORDER BY
    2 DESC
    -- LIMIT
    --   1
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT
    AVG(predicted_duration_minutes) AS avg_predicted_trip_length
    FROM
    ML.PREDICT(
        MODEL `qwiklabs-gcp-01-93ef79d4da86.austin.subscriber_model`
        , (
        SELECT
            start_station_name
            , EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour
            , subscriber_type
            , duration_minutes
        FROM
            `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` trips
        WHERE
            EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
            AND subscriber_type = 'Single Trip'
            AND start_station_name = '...........'
        )
    )
    ```
