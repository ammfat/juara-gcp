# Getting Started with BigQuery Machine Learning

1. Create dataset `bqml_lab`.

1. Create a Logistic Reg. model.

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL
        `qwiklabs-gcp-02-5d3afdd9dbbc.bqml_lab.sample_model`
    OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS (
    SELECT
        IF (totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label
        , IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os
        , device.isMobile AS is_mobile
        , IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
        , IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
    WHERE
        _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
    LIMIT
        100000
    )
    ```

1. Evaluate the model.

    ```sql
    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    ml.EVALUATE(
        MODEL `qwiklabs-gcp-02-5d3afdd9dbbc.bqml_lab.sample_model`
        , (
            SELECT
            IF (totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label
            , IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os
            , device.isMobile AS is_mobile
            , IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
            , IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
            FROM
            `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
            WHERE
            _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'
            LIMIT
            100000
        )
    )
    ```

1. Use the model.

    Basic:
    ```sql
    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    ml.PREDICT(
        MODEL `qwiklabs-gcp-02-5d3afdd9dbbc.bqml_lab.sample_model`
        , (
            SELECT
            IF (totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label
            , IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os
            , device.isMobile AS is_mobile
            , IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
            , IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
            FROM
            `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
            WHERE
            _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'
        )
    )
    ```
    
    Group by country:
    ```sql
    SELECT
    country
    , SUM(predicted_label) AS total_predicted_purchases
    FROM
    ml.PREDICT(
        MODEL `qwiklabs-gcp-02-5d3afdd9dbbc.bqml_lab.sample_model`
        , (
            SELECT
            IF (totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label
            , IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os
            , device.isMobile AS is_mobile
            , IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
            , IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
            FROM
            `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
            WHERE
            _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'
        )
    )
    GROUP BY
    country
    ORDER BY
    total_predicted_purchases DESC
    LIMIT
    10
    ```

    Purchases per user:
    ```sql
    SELECT
    fullVisitorId
    , SUM(predicted_label) AS total_predicted_purchases
    FROM
    ml.PREDICT(
        MODEL `qwiklabs-gcp-02-5d3afdd9dbbc.bqml_lab.sample_model`
        , (
            SELECT
            IF (totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label
            , IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os
            , device.isMobile AS is_mobile
            , IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
            , IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
            , fullVisitorId
            FROM
            `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
            WHERE
            _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'
        )
    )
    GROUP BY
    fullVisitorId
    ORDER BY
    total_predicted_purchases DESC
    LIMIT
    10
    ```

1. Predict which new visitors will come back and purchase

    ```sql
    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    ml.PREDICT(MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`,
        (
        WITH
        all_visitor_stats AS (
        SELECT
            fullvisitorid,
        IF
            (COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0
                AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
        FROM
            `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
        GROUP BY
            fullvisitorid )
        SELECT
        CONCAT(fullvisitorid, '-',CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,
        # labels
        will_buy_on_return_visit,
        MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,
        # behavior on the site
        IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
        IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,
        totals.pageviews,
        # where the visitor came from
        trafficSource.source,
        trafficSource.medium,
        channelGrouping,
        # mobile or desktop
        device.deviceCategory,
        # geographic
        IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
        FROM
        `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
        UNNEST(hits) AS h
        JOIN
        all_visitor_stats
        USING
        (fullvisitorid)
        WHERE
        # only predict for new visits
        totals.newVisits = 1
        AND date BETWEEN '20170701'
        AND '20170801' # test 1 month
        GROUP BY
        unique_session_id,
        will_buy_on_return_visit,
        bounces,
        time_on_site,
        totals.pageviews,
        trafficSource.source,
        trafficSource.medium,
        channelGrouping,
        device.deviceCategory,
        country ) )
    ORDER BY
    predicted_will_buy_on_return_visit DESC;
    ```

### Additional information

**Tip**: add warm_start = true to your model options if you are retraining new data on an existing model for faster training times. Note that you cannot change the feature columns (this would necessitate a new model).

**roc_auc** is just one of the performance metrics available during model evaluation. Also available are accuracy, precision, and recall. Knowing which performance metric to rely on is highly dependent on what your overall objective or goal is.
